Glance Editor is a Free and Open Source text editor designed for eye control users. People that only use their mouse to use the computer will be able to have most important functionalities by clicking the action buttons available in the program, without having to make control commands on the virtual keyboard.

## Text scrolling

To scroll up or down you can use the sidebar on the right, but this is the traditional way.

When you hover the **scroll spaces**, as shown bellow, you can scroll up and down easily, without making any drag or roll gesture with the mouse.

## Project Status

What it still needs to be done? Actually, lot's of things...
Even though you can use Glance Editor at this moment, there are still some problems I need to solve for it to be more useful. Since I am still very new in web development, I am still working / planning to work on this project to help people with what I think it's important.

- [ ] Rethink the code structure and write clean code (and probably use a JS Framework like VueJS). **Very important**
- [ ] Implement a file explorer panel
- [ ] Implement tabs
- [ ] Implement snippets and custom snippets creation and other utilities
- [ ] Use new Electron's new security philosophies (even though Glance Editor don't use any external source, so it's probably not a big deal)
- [ ] Write a better font and theme integration (and also make the default themes look more "attractive")
- [ ] Make a welcome dialog where the user will be able make some configurations on the fly
- [ ] Make better and more featured settings system
